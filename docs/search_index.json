Some people treat them as a way of entertainment or pressure release and spend a substainable amount of time to improve rankings, euqipments or game experience. In this project, our team wants to explore three main questions relating to the platforms – the places where the video games are published, the difference between critics’ preference and users’ preference, and the difference between popularity in US and Japan. Which platform contributes most to the video games? Is there any change over time? In terms of comparing the competitiveness of platforms, we are mainly interested in two main areas: the total number of games published and the total amount of sales generated by that platform. What are the critics’ preference and users’ preference? How are they different? To help players obtain a comprehensive review on video games, data source provides critics’ scores and users’ scores. From these two columns, we could sort the most popular genres among critics and general players based on a standardized scoring scale (out of ten), and study what the influential factors are. What are the top 5 popular video games and genres in North America and Japan? Is there any difference? we can use histograms,stacked bar charts, or tree maps to compare the sales of different genres in different regions. "]]
