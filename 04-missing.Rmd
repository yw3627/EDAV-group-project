# Missing values

## Missing data Count
We can see the total number of NAs in each column for each dataset:
```{r}
colSums(is.na(dataset))
```

## Visualizing Missing data in dataset
```{r}
extracat::visna(dataset,sort = "b")
```

The blue represents missing values. The rows show a missing pattern and the columns represent the column level missing values. We can find out that there is a substaintial amount of data missing values for user score, critic score, and sales for all regions.

## Deleting NAs

We use na.omit to delete the rows with missing values and check the updated dataset with graph.

```{r}
dataset = na.omit(dataset)

library(mi)
x=missing_data.frame(as.data.frame(dataset))
image(x)
```

Black area represents missing values. Since there is no dark area, our data is now practicable and usable after using na.omit().
